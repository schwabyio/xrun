# xRun - CLI Runner For Postman

## Overview
xRun is a command line interface (CLI) app that extends [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) to enable your organization to run Postman tests with speed and at scale.

## Features
* Direct support for [xtest](https://github.com/schwabyio/xtest).
* Run Postman tests in parallel by setting the `limitConcurrency` configuration.
* Run tests locally or as part of Continuous Integration (CI) with your automated build server of choice.
* Generates clean html reports that allow you to quickly filter and zero in on test failures.
* Generate junit reports (provided by Postman's Newman).
* Configurable settings.json file with command line override capability.
* By default, all folders (and tests within) are run. You can exclude folders using an exclusion list.
* Single out one or more tests to run by specifying a CSV list of test cases and/or directories from the command line.

## xRun Project Repo Structure
The xRun tool requires a Postman project repo to be in the following structure:
```
└── <your-project-repo>/
    ├── <directory1-with-postman-json-files>/
    ├── <directory2-with-postman-json-files>/
    ...
    ├── <directoryN-with-postman-json-files>/
    └── xrun/
        ├── exclude-list.json
        └── settings.json
```
Note: You can only run the `xrun` CLI command from the root directory of `<your-project-repo>`.
